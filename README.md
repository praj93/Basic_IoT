# Basic_IoT
Some basic IoT implementations using NodeMCU(esp8266) and an Ultasonic sensor.

Ultasonic sensor(hc-sr04) is used to find the distance of an object from the device itself. The sensor provides 2cm to 400cm of non-contact measurement functionality with a ranging accuracy that can reach up to 3mm.
We will print the distance of how far an object is from the sensor in two different ways.

    It contains the arduino code, hardware description and the output images to print the distance in the serial monitor.
